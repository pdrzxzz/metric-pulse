# MetricPulse

**Interactive tool to explore classification metrics and threshold effects**

---

## About

MetricPulse is a simple, interactive web app designed to help users understand how changing the classification threshold impacts key binary classification metrics like **Precision**, **Recall**, and **F1-score**.

By adjusting the threshold slider, users can see in real time how metrics respond on a fixed dataset with predicted probabilities and true labels. This hands-on experience deepens intuition about the trade-offs involved in classification decisions.

## Features

- Visualize Precision, Recall, and F1-score dynamically as threshold changes
- Confusion matrix updates with threshold adjustments
- Interactive slider to select threshold value between 0 and 1
- Example dataset with predicted probabilities and true labels included
- Clean, minimal interface focused on learning and experimentation

---

## Technologies

- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (vanilla or with a lightweight framework)
- Visualization: Chart.js or D3.js for dynamic charts
- Optional Backend: Python (Flask) for serving dataset and computations (can also be fully client-side)

## How to Use

1. Open the app in your browser.
2. Use the slider to adjust the classification threshold.
3. Watch how the Precision, Recall, and F1-score change in response.
4. Observe the confusion matrix update to reflect predictions based on the current threshold.
